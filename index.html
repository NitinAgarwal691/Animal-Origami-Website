        <h1>Origami Designs</h1>
        <h3>Origami is derived from two Japanese words: Ori (folded) and Kami (paper). Before that, the art was called “orikata” (folded shapes).</li>
            An ancient Japanese legend says if you fold one thousand cranes you will be granted a wish.
            No scissors allowed! Traditional origami uses a piece of paper in the shape of a square.
